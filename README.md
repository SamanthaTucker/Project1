# Project1

A memory based game where the user must memorize a popup sequence and click the gameboards icon's in the correct sequence it displayed. As levels progress, the sequences will increase as well as the gameboards icons. The user will offically win the game after a certain amount of levels have been completed.
The cards on a grid layout will start out blank, when the user begins the game, each level will have the cards flip over showing a plant one at a time in a certain sequence. For eample: Like tic tac toe mixed with simon says.
