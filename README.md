# Project1

A memory based game where the user must memorize a popup sequence and click the gameboards icon's in the correct sequence it displayed. As levels progress, the sequences will increase as well as the gameboards icons. The user will offically win the game after a certain amount of levels have been completed.
The cards on a grid layout will start out blank, when the user begins the game, each level will have the cards flip over showing a plant one at a time in a certain sequence. For eample: Like tic tac toe mixed with simon says.

# User Stories:
* As a User, I should be able to restart my game at any time.
* As a User, I should be able to click a dropdown menu to display the instructions./ I should be able to clearly read the instructions of the game.
* As a User, the game should be easy to follow.
* As a User, I should be able to choose if I want to play One-player or Two-player.
* As a User, I should understand that each card that pops up in a 1, 2, 3..ect Sequence, needs to be memorized and matched by my clicks
* As a User, I should have fun with this memory game, and enjoy the increase in difficulty throughout the levels.

#Forthcoming Features:
* The cards will be able to flip to a blank side so the user wont be able to see all the match cards yet.
* Matched cards will turn green and do an animation once a match is found!
* When a match is not found, cards will turn red, do an animation, and reset to be clicked again.
* Two-player mode!! When game is loaded, user will be promped to click One player or Two players, screen will adjust amount of gameboards based on the users answer.
* More complex levels! As of right now, my game is very simple. I'd like to impliment more difficult levels/ timed levels to gain points to show users their scores to reach a Win.
